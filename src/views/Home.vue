    <p>
        Hello, I'm Eric.  I'm a full-stack web developer with proficiency in PHP and JavaScript.
        I am also skilled in the Linux command line and working with and configuring web servers using Apache or nginx.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have worked with various JavaScript libraries such as Ext JS and Vue.js.
        This website is actually built in Vue.js and deployed on to a server that I manage.
    </p>
    <p>
        For personal projects, I use Python to create simple programs to help me complete tasks.
        Tasks such as <a href="https://gist.github.com/NTICompass/f7692aa8b7ba536666c4dab878efbe97" target="_blank">solving a math puzzle</a>
        or <a href="https://github.com/NTICompass/mms-viewer" target="_blank">manually downloading MMS messages on my old phone</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my hobbies is collecting and working with vintage computers.  I have a large
        <a href="https://generic.computers.pictures/computers" target="_blank">collection of systems</a> that I have restored or am working on restoring.
